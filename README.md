| -s, --substitution-dir  | .              | Path to directory containing audio files used to produce new loops based on the source audio. If left unspecified, the source directory is used for substitutions as well                                          |
| -o, --output            | .              | Path to output directory                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| -src, --source-dir      | .              | Path to directory containing source audio files. These are then sliced and data for each slice is used to inform what audio events from the substitutions directory to replace them with                           |
| -s, --seed              | `current time` | Seed for random number generator                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| --one-shot-mode         | `false`        | Use one shots instead of loops as substitutions for loop generation. If long is specified, the special LongOneShotMode is enabled, which extracts several shorter one shots from longer sustained one shot sounds. |
| --strategy              | `Interleave`   | Strategy for generating audio sequences                                                                                                                                                                            |

| --normalize-durations   | `False`        | Normalize durations of candidates so that they fall within the same range as the source durations, thus making for better matches with the source event durations                                                  |
| --min-duration          | `1`            | Minimum duration of extracted audio clips in seconds                                                                                                                                                               |
